# Respawn Tools

Mod commissioned for the Rusty Gears SMP server. For now, this mod is a Proof of Concept, and is being released as a Minimial Viable Product.

Scalability and stability of long-term use of this mod on a multi-player server has yet to be determined.

Feel free to use this mod, however please respect it's limitiations, as it has been designed specifically for a single group of players.

## Features:
  
 - ### **Respawn Beacon**
 
    Adds a `Respawn Beacon` block, that when Enabled, will cause any players in range, to respawn on the block when they die, rather than at their default spawn position.

     - Client: Shift-Right Click to toggle the settings window for the beacon.
        - Change the range of the beacon. Defaults to 128 blocks.
        - Turn the beacon on or off.
